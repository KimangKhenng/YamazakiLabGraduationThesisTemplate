    abstract = {Unlike popular modularized framework, end-to-end autonomous driving seeks to solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which can be more adapting to new scenarios and easier to generalize at scale. However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and can only deal with simple driving tasks like lane keeping. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask can be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate property in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests with a simulated autonomous car in CARLA show that the performance of our method in urban scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned policy is able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving environment. The codes and videos of this work are available at our github repo and project website.},

@article{peng2021end,
    abstract = {<p> Recent years have seen the rapid development of autonomous driving systems, which are typically designed in a hierarchical architecture or an end-to-end architecture. The hierarchical architecture is always complicated and hard to design, while the end-to-end architecture is more promising due to its simple structure. This paper puts forward an end-to-end autonomous driving method through a deep reinforcement learning algorithm Dueling Double Deep Q-Network, making it possible for the vehicle to learn end-to-end driving by itself. This paper firstly proposes an architecture for the end-to-end lane-keeping task. Unlike the traditional image-only state space, the presented state space is composed of both camera images and vehicle motion information. Then corresponding dueling neural network structure is introduced, which reduces the variance and improves sampling efficiency. Thirdly, the proposed method is applied to The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) to demonstrate its great performance, where it surpasses human drivers. Finally, the saliency map of the neural network is visualized, which indicates the trained network drives by observing the lane lines.

With the development of knowledge through trial and error, the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique shows its feasibility for the intelligent traffic lights control. However, the general DRL algorithms cannot meet the demands of agents for coordination within large complex road networks. In this article, we introduce a new Cooperative Group-Based Multi-Agent reinforcement learning-ATSC (CGB-MATSC) framework. It is based on Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS) to realize effective control in the large-scale road network. We propose a CGB-MAQL algorithm that applies k-nearest-neighbor-based state representation, pheromone-based regional green-wave control mode, and spatial discounted reward to stabilize the learning convergence. Extensive experiments and ablation studies of the CGB-MAQL algorithm show its effectiveness and scalability in the synthetic road network, Monaco city and Harbin city scenarios. Results demonstrate that compared with a set of general control methods, our algorithm can better control multiple intersection cases on congestion alleviation and environmental protection.}

Numerous AIM designs have been proposed, but they lack a common vision of what defines a good system. In this study, the authors discuss a set of conflicting evaluation criteria that need to be balanced in the design of an AIM system, but are often considered individually in the literature. They then introduce their own priority-based design, where an intersection controller assigns priorities to incoming vehicles. On being assigned a priority, vehicles then cross the intersection while maintaining a so-called brake-safe state with respect to higher priority vehicles, rendering the system robust. They have performed extensive simulations to showcase the properties of the proposed system, and notably that it satisfactorily balances their criteria while remaining efficient.},

    abstract = {Autonomous driving has attracted significant research interests in the past two decades as it offers many potential benefits, including releasing drivers from exhausting driving and mitigating traffic congestion, among others. Despite promising progress, lane-changing remains a great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AV), especially in mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for lane-changing decision makings in AVs with encouraging results demonstrated. However, the majority of those studies are focused on a single-vehicle setting, and lane-changing in the context of multiple AVs coexisting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have received scarce attention. In this paper, we formulate the lane-changing decision-making of multiple AVs in a mixed-traffic highway environment as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where each AV makes lane-changing decisions based on the motions of both neighboring AVs and HDVs. Specifically, a multi-agent advantage actor-critic (MA2C) method is proposed with a novel local reward design and a parameter sharing scheme. In particular, a multi-objective reward function is designed to incorporate fuel efficiency, driving comfort, and the safety of autonomous driving. A comprehensive experimental study is made that our proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of efficiency, safety, and driver comfort.}

    abstract = {A major challenge concerning a mixed traffic flow system, composed of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is how to improve overall efficiency and safety by assigning appropriate control strategies to CAVs. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to address this challenge. It enables the joint training of multiple CAVs by fusing CAV sensing information and does not need compliance of HDVs. However, the fusion of CAV sensing information is non-trivial. Traditional DRL models usually fail to take advantage of connectivity among CAVs and time series characteristics of vehicle sensing information, leading to insufficient awareness of the traffic environment. Aimed at tackling these issues, this study proposes a DRL framework named spatiotemporal deep Q network (STDQN), by integrating a double deep Q network (DDQN) and a spatiotemporal information extraction module. A longâ€“short term memory neural network with an attention mechanism (AttenLSTMNN) is leveraged to extract temporal dependencies from vehicle perceptive information. In addition, a graph convolution network (GCN) is employed to model the spatial correlations among vehicles in a local range, as well as the connectivity of multiple CAVs in a global range. Simulation experiments are conducted in an onramp merging scenario, which is one of the most important and commonly seen scenarios in highway or city expressway systems. Experimental results prove that as compared to baseline DRL and rule-based methods, the proposed STDQN can improve the overall traffic efficiency, safety, and driving comfort. The proposed framework is promised to be deployed into real CAVs, to realize cooperative, safe, and efficient autonomous driving.}
