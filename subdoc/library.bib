Firstly, we provide a practical implementation of the agent programming language MetateM, extended with abilities and beliefs. Second, we extend both the implementation and application to encompass simple, but powerful grouping structures. We show how a number of sophisticated applications can be naturally developed based on these rational agent groups. Finally, in addition to providing operational semantics for both single and multi-agent implementations, we show how the grouping structures correspond closely to complex process calculi for mobile agents.},

   abstract = {Software architectures of large multi-agent systems (MASs) are inherently complex and have to cope with an increasing number of system-wide properties and their corresponding control policies. With the openness and increasing size and complexity of these systems a more sophisticated software architectural approach becomes necessary. In this context, we propose the Reflective Blackboard architectural pattern, which is the result of the composition of two other well-known architectural patterns: the Blackboard pattern and the Reflection pattern. The proposed pattern provides, early in the architectural design stage, the context in which more detailed decisions related to systemic properties and associated policies can be made in late stages of MAS development. The pattern allows for a better separation of concerns, supporting the separate handling of control strategies by means of the computational reflection technique. Moreover these control activities are handled independently from the application data and agents, providing a better architecture for real-life multi-agent systems. An electronic marketplace architecture, with the goal of interconnecting providers and consumers of goods and services to find one another and transact business electronically, is assumed as a case study through the paper to clarify all the expressed concepts and to show the applicability of our proposal. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

   abstract = {Air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. The FAA estimates that in 2005 alone, there were over 322,000 hours of delays at a cost to the industry in excess of three billion dollars. Finding reliable and adaptive solutions to the flow management problem is of paramount importance if the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems are to achieve the stated goal of accommodating three times the current traffic volume. This problem is particularly complex as it requires the integration and/or coordination of many factors including: new data (e.g., changing weather info), potentially conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and very heavy traffic volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace). In this paper we use FACET -- an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry -- to test a multi-agent algorithm for traffic flow management. An agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and its action consists of setting the separation required among the airplanes going though that fix. Agents use reinforcement learning to set this separation and their actions speed up or slow down traffic to manage congestion. Our FACET based results show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 45% over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 67% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).},

   abstract = {Intelligent air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental chal-lenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. FAA estimates put weather, routing decisions and airport condition induced delays at 1,682,700 hours in 2007 [18], resulting in a staggering economic loss of over $41 Billion [42]. New solutions to the flow management are needed to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic anticipated over the next two decades. Indeed, this is a complex problem where the interactions of changing conditions (e.g., weather), conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and heavy volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace) demand an adaptive and robust solution. In this paper we explore a multiagent algorithm where agents use reinforcement learning to reduce congestion through local actions. Each agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and has one of three actions: setting separation between airplanes, ordering ground delays or performing reroutes. We simulate air traffic using FACET which is an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. Our FACET simulations on both artificial and real historical data from the Chicago and New York airspaces show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 80% over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 90% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).},

   abstract = {Stress-inducible transcription factors play a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to environment to maintain homeostasis and integrity of the genome. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is induced by a variety of stress and inflammatory conditions and is over-expressed in many kinds of cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropic functions of ATF3 have remained elusive. Here we employed systems analysis to identify genome-wide targets of ATF3 that is either induced by an alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or over-expressed in a prostate tumour cell line LNCaP. We show that stress-induced and cancer-associated ATF3 is recruited to 5,984 and 1,423 targets, respectively, in the human genome, 89% of which are common. Notably, ATF3 targets are highly enriched for not only ATF/CRE motifs but also binding sites of several other stress-inducible transcription factors indicating an extensive network of stress response factors in transcriptional regulation of target genes. Further analysis of effects of ATF3 knockdown on these targets revealed that stress-induced ATF3 regulates genes in metabolic pathways, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and signalling including insulin, p53, Wnt, and VEGF pathways. Cancer-associated ATF3 is involved in regulation of distinct sets of genes in processes such as calcium signalling, Wnt, p53 and diabetes pathways. Notably, stress-induced ATF3 binds to 40% of p53 targets and activates pro-apoptotic genes such as TNFRSF10B/DR5 and BBC3/PUMA. Cancer-associated ATF3, by contrast, represses these pro-apoptotic genes in addition to CDKN1A/p21. Taken together, our data reveal an extensive network of stress-inducible transcription factors and demonstrate that ATF3 has opposing, cell context-dependent effects on p53 target genes in DNA damage response and cancer development.},

Negotiation between ISP and driver agents seek a more efficient route allocation across time and space.

Abstract Air traffic management ensures the safety of flight by optimizing flows and maintaining separation between aircraft. After giving some definitions, some typical feature of aircraft trajectories are presented. Trajectories are objects belonging to spaces with infinite dimensions. The naive way to address such problem is to sample trajectories at some regular points and to create a big vector of positions (and or speeds). In order to manipulate such objects with algorithms, one must reduce the dimension of the search space by using more efficient representations. Some dimension reduction tricks are then presented for which advantages and drawbacks are presented. Then, front propagation approaches are introduced with a focus on Fast Marching Algorithms and Ordered upwind algorithms. An example of application of such algorithm to a real instance of air traffic control problem is also given. When aircraft dynamics have to be included in the model, optimal control approaches are really efficient. We present also some application to aircraft trajectory design. Finally , we introduce some path planning techniques via natural language processing and mathematical programming.},

In this context, most work has gone into discovering subgraph patterns, where the task is to find strictly defined frequently re-occurring structures, i.e., node labels always interconnected in the same way. Recently, efforts have been made to relax these strict demands, and to simply look for node labels that frequently occur near each other. In this setting, we propose to mine association rules between such node labels, thus discovering additional information about correlations and interactions between node labels. We present an algorithm that discovers rules that allow us to claim that if a set of labels is encountered in a graph, there is a high probability that some other set of labels can be found nearby. Experiments confirm that our algorithm efficiently finds valuable rules that existing methods fail to discover.},

The other concerns small-scale, `local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary.

Because a deficit of GABA neurons has been found in some of these syndromes, notably in patients with X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, epilepsy was suggested to result from an imbalance in GABAergic inhibition, and the notion of "interneuronopathy" was proposed. Here, we studied the impact of a polyalanine expansion of aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene, a mutation notably found in West and Ohtahara syndromes. Analysis of Arx((GCG)7/Y) knock-in mice revealed that GABA neuron development is not affected. Moreover, pyramidal cell migration and cortical layering are unaltered in these mice. Interestingly, electrophysiological recordings show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons displayed a frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents similar to wild-type (WT) mice. However, these neurons show a dramatic increase in the frequency of excitatory inputs associated with a remodeling of their axonal arborization, suggesting that epilepsy in Arx((GCG)7/Y)mice would result from a glutamate network remodeling. We therefore propose that secondary alterations are instrumental for the development of disease-specific phenotypes and should be considered to explain the phenotypic diversity associated with epileptogenic mutations.},

New building regulations have an explicit orientation toward low-emission and energy-efficient designs. However, the optimal design of residential buildings should consider multiple, and usually competitive, objectives such as energy consumption optimization, financial costs reduction and decrease of environmental impacts. This makes it a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. The aim of this work is to develop a novel method to tackle the problem. A multi-objective optimization model based on harmony search algorithm (HS) is presented. This model is developed to minimize the life cycle cost (LCC) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions of the buildings. Several building envelope parameters are taken as the design variables. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach the performance of the model is tested on a typical single-family house. For the case of such a house, the model proves to be efficient, and a set of optimal combinations (Pareto optimal solutions) is obtained. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The ventilation demand is primarily related to the occupant load. In this study, the ventilation demands due to occupant load variations were examined against certain IAQ objectives using the mass balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) volume fractions in an air-conditioned office. In particular, this study proposed a transient ventilation demand model for occupant load, with the parameters determined from a year-round occupant load survey in Hong Kong. This model was applied to evaluate the performance of energy saving in different operating schedules of ventilation systems for typical office buildings in Hong Kong. The results showed that the energy consumption of a ventilation system would be correlated with the transient occupant load and its variations in the air-conditioned office. The ventilation system, with schedules taking account of the transient occupant loads, would offer a reduction in energy consumption up to 19% as compared with an operating schedule that assumed a steady occupant-load in the office during working hours. In both cases, the same IAQ objective was achieved. © 2007.},

We have found that exploiting building-wide multivariable interactions between CO2, humidity, pressure, occupancy, and temperature leads to significant reductions of energy intensity. Our analysis indicates that it is possible to obtain drastic energy savings compared with traditional control strategies. The exploitation of the thermal comfort zone has been found to be the most relevant factor driving energy savings. We discuss strategies to handle multiple competing objectives as well as economic functions and we analyze financial incentives provided by real-time prices and existing market designs. Numerical experiments are provided to support the claims. ■},

   abstract = {This paper investigates the issue of tuning the Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) controller parameters for a greenhouse climate control system using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) based on multiple performance measures such as good static-dynamic performance specifications and the smooth process of control. A model of nonlinear thermodynamic laws between numerous system variables affecting the greenhouse climate is formulated. The proposed tuning scheme is tested for greenhouse climate control by minimizing the integrated time square error (ITSE) and the control increment or rate in a simulation experiment. The results show that by tuning the gain parameters the controllers can achieve good control performance through step responses such as small overshoot, fast settling time, and less rise time and steady state error. Besides, it can be applied to tuning the system with different properties, such as strong interactions among variables, nonlinearities and conflicting performance criteria. The results implicate that it is a quite effective and promising tuning method using multi-objective optimization algorithms in the complex greenhouse production.},

   abstract = {The potential systemic differences in performance of natural, exhaust and mechanical ventilation in dwellings is the object of relentless debate among scientists, industry and policy makers, although comparisons found in literature often fail to compare the different systems on an equal basis. Presenting the results from a multi zone simulation based optimization study of residential ventilation design flow rates and sizing of the system components, this paper aims to provide a benchmark for achievable performance for the different systems for moderate climate regions (eg. Western Europe), as well as point to possible sizing strategies for future standards. The results clearly demonstrate that, considering average occupant exposure to metabolic carbon dioxide, there are small differences in the optimal performance for the 3 system approaches, with an increase of about 13% in ventilation heat loss for equal exposure for the natural ventilation system compared to the mechanical ventilation system. These differences are more marked (up to 26%) when peak exposure is considered. For typically household activity related sources, the mechanical and exhaust ventilation systems provide substantially better optimal performance, while building tighter improved the performance of all 3 system approaches. Exhaust ventilation benefits from small trickle ventilators and large transfer devices. The latter also improves the performance of natural ventilation systems, while slightly higher supply flow rates provide the best results for mechanical ventilation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, an analytical model for a flat-plate counter-cross-flow liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) is compared with experimental test results and numerical simulations for a single LAMEE and a RAMEE system under various operating conditions. Agreements are obtained among the analytical, experimental and numerical results. The effectiveness of a RAMEE system under balanced and unbalanced airflow conditions is evaluated by using the analytical model. Optimization studies for exchanger size and solution flow rate in RAMEE systems are investigated. Results show that RAMEE systems with equal-sized supply and exhaust exchangers can achieve the highest effectiveness in most conditions for both balanced and unbalanced airflow.

The optimization of building energy is therefore a complex problem highly dependent on unique building and environmental conditions as well as on time dependent operational factors. To provide computational support for this optimization, this paper presents and implements a multi-agent comfort and energy simulation (MACES) to model alternative management and control of building systems and occupants. Human and device agents are used to explore current trends in energy consumption and management of a university test bed building. Reactive and predictive control strategies are then imposed on device agents in an attempt to reduce building energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. Finally, occupant agents are motivated by simulation feedback to accept more energy conscious scheduling through multi-agent negotiations. Initial results of the MACES demonstrate potential energy savings of 17% while maintaining a high level of occupant comfort. This work is intended to demonstrate a simulation tool, which is implementable in the actual test bed site and compatible with real-world input to instigate and motivate more energy conscious control and occupant behaviors.},

   abstract = {A criterion, based on optimization principles, for determining the SAT setpoint in VAV systems is presented. It is generally accepted that conventional SAT reset controls (SATRC), bounded by either space humidity or ductwork size, will save cooling and/or heating energy. However, the ventilation consequences and penalty resulting from increased fan power have generally been overlooked. Ventilation is impacted since changes in the SAT setpoint change the primary airflow rate and the operation of economizer cycles, i.e. the distribution of fresh outdoor air (OA). These changes may result in extra energy demand and ventilation inefficiency if the reset criterion is not appropriate. This optimization concept simultaneously reduces energy consumption and meets ventilation requirements. Simulation results illustrate that the use of the optimized SATRC saves more energy than a conventional one.},

   abstract = {Ventilation systems in subway stations have been mainly used to control indoor air pollutants. Conventional control systems using manual control or proportional integral derivative (PID) control are widely implemented without considering the energy cost. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) which determines optimal set points of model predictive control (MPC) is developed to ensure healthy indoor air quality (IAQ) as well as to minimize energy consumption. First, three first-order plus time delay models are obtained by using the system identification method, which can be used to control the concentration of particulate matter (PM) at the platform. The input variable of the process model is the speed of the fan inverter and the other two disturbances are the train schedule and the concentration of outside PM 10. Next, based on the understanding of IAQ dynamics, the MPC controller that provides optimal control actions is then developed in the D-station of the Korean subway. The multi-objective genetic algorithm with Pareto optimal objective is adopted to determine the optimal set points of the MPC. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed multi-objective optimization ventilation control is superior to that of manual control, both in terms of IAQ and energy savings. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Results suggest 5% cost savings during the study period. Second, the environment is used to determine hourly supply water temperature and circulator availability that minimize daily energy consumption for a small office building having a thermally activated building system (TABS).

By introducing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based model reduction technique into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the spatial distributions of key environmental parameters are firstly considered in optimization procedure, which enable to help improve the environment comfort of occupied zones in a office room. Four types of low-dimension parameter spaces are acquired by POD method including indoor temperature, airflow, CO2concentration and predicted mean vote (PMV) distributions. The precisions of the reconstructed spaces are compared with those of CFD-based original ones. Because of the extremely lower dimension, resulted parameter subspaces are suitable for optimization process in this study. In the proposed genetic algorithm (GA), the objective function is constructed in a way attempting to aggregate and weight indices into one indicator, such as index of PMV, space temperature gradients (STG), indoor air quality (IAQ), energy cost of heating and cooling, etc. A simulation based case study is conducted, which indicates that the presented optimization approach is able to improve indoor comfort and energy costs of ventilation system in a balanced way. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Buildings account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption. About 40% and 15% of that are consumed, respec- tively, by HVAC and lighting. These energy uses can be reduced by integrated control of active and passive sources of heating, cooling, lighting, shading and ventilation. However, rigorous studies of such control strategies are lacking since computation- ally tractable models are not available. In this paper, a novel formulation capturing key interactions of the above building functions is established to minimize the total daily energy cost. To obtain effective integrated strategies in a timely manner, a methodology that combines stochastic dynamic programming (DP) and the rollout technique is developed within the price-based coordination framework. For easy implementation, DP-derived heuristic rules are developed to coordinate shading blinds and natural ventilation, with simplified optimization strategies for HVAC and lighting systems. Numerical simulation results show that these strategies are scalable, and can effectively reduce energy costs and improve human comfort. Note},

We carried out a retrospective analysis of anti-HLA antibodies in 63 clinically indicated nephrectomies (baseline and three and 12 months after) according to the time elapsed since transplantation (six months) and clinical background. An intervention study included 10 patients without donor-specific antibodies (DSA) at the time of nephrectomy treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (1.5 g/kg). Early nephrectomies were performed in 15 patients (24%). Among the late nephrectomies, 14 patients (22%) were asymptomatic and 34 (54%) had graft intolerance syndrome (GIS). At baseline, anti-HLA sensitization was significantly lower in the early and late asymptomatic groups than in the GIS group, but increased considerably within the three months following surgery. In the group of 10 patients treated with IVIG, only the number of class I non-DSA increased in the three months after surgery, whereas in the control group (N = 13), all anti-HLA variables increased significantly. All patients undergoing a clinically indicated allograft nephrectomy become highly sensitized within the 12 months after surgery. In patients without DSA before nephrectomy, high doses of IVIG may prevent anti-HLA sensitization.},

   abstract = {The access control mechanisms of existing mainstream operating systems are inadequate to provide strong system security. Enhanced access control mechanisms have failed to win acceptance into mainstream operating systems due in part to a lack of consensus within the security community on the right solution. Since general-purpose operating systems must satisfy a wide range of user requirements, any access control mechanism integrated into such a system must be capable of supporting many different access control models. The Linux Security Modules (LSM) project has developed a lightweight, general purpose, access control framework for the mainstream Linux kernel that enables many different access control models to be implemented as loadable kernel modules. A number of existing enhanced access control implementations, including Linux capabilities, Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), and Domain and Type Enforcement (DTE), have already been adapted to use the LSM framework. This paper presents the design and implementation of LSM and discusses the challenges in providing a truly general solution that minimally impacts the Linux kernel. (46 References).},

In recent years, a wide variety of security tools have been developed that use this technique. This approach brings with it a host of pitfalls for the unwary implementer that if overlooked can allow his tool to be easily circumvented. To shed light on these problems, we present the lessons we learned in the course of several design and implementation cycles with our own system call interposition-based sandboxing tool. We first present some of the problems and pitfalls we encountered, including incorrectly replicating OS semantics, overlooking indirect paths to resources, race conditions, incorrectly subsetting a complex interface, and side effects of denying system calls. We then present some practical solutions to these problems, and provide general principles for avoiding the difficulties we encountered.},

Dynamic changes of the Synechocystis proteome to CO(2) limitation were investigated using shotgun LC-MS/MS approach with isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technique. Synechocystis cells grown at high (3%) CO(2) were shifted to air-level CO(2) followed by protein extraction after 6, 24, and 72 h. About 19% of the cyanobacterial proteome was identified and the expression changes were quantified for 17% of theoretical ORFs. For 76 proteins, up- or down-regulation was found to be significant (more than 1.5 or less than 0.7). Major changes were observed in proteins participating in inorganic carbon uptake, CO(2) fixation, nitrogen transport and assimilation, as well as in the protection of the photosynthetic machinery from excess of light. Further, a number of hypothetical proteins with unknown functions were discovered. In general, the cells appear to acclimate to low CO(2) without a significant stress since the stress-related molecular chaperones were down-regulated and only a minor decline was detected for proteins of phycobilisomes, photosynthetic complexes, and translation machinery. The results of iTRAQ experiment were validated by the Western blot analysis for selected proteins.},

The latter can be done in different ways that may have considerable influence on the total cost of the algorithm. In this paper, we try to diminish this influence as far as possible. For example, we present an algorithm for the integration problem that reduces the time for the calculation and exposition of the coefficients in such a way that for increasing dimension, this time is small compared to dn, where n is the number of involved function values.},

   abstract = {In this paper we propose an hybrid segmentation algorithm which incorporates the advantages of the efficient graph based segmentation and normalized cuts partitioning algorithm. The proposed method requires low computational complexity and is therefore suitable for real-time image segmentation processing. Moreover, it provides effective and robust segmentation. For that, our method consists first, at segmenting the input image by the “Efficient Graph-Based” segmentation. The segmented regions are then represented by a graph structure. As a final step, the normalized cuts partitioning algorithm is applied to the resulting graph in order to remove non-significant regions. In the proposed method, the main computational cost is the efficient graph based segmentation cost since the computational cost of partitioning regions using the Ncut method is negligibly small. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a large number of experiments using different natural scene images.},

The extent to which this tradeoff is determined by the average parallelism of the software system, as contrasted with other, more detailed, characterizations, is shown. The extent to which both speedup and efficiency can simultaneously be poor is bound: it is shown that for any software system and any number of processors, the sum of the average processor utilization (i.e. efficiency) and the attained fraction of the maximum possible speedup must exceed one. Bounds are given on speedup and efficiency, and on the incremental benefit and cost of allocating additional processors. An explicit formulation, as well as bounds, are given for the location of the knee of the execution time-efficiency profile, where the benefit per unit cost is maximized},

Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previous human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We also discuss the approaches for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak.},

   abstract = {Background: Hurricane Ike struck the Galveston Bay area of Texas on September 13, 2008, leaving substantial destruction and a number of deaths in its wake. We assessed differences in the determinants of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression after this event, including the particular hurricane experiences, including postevent nontraumatic stressors, that were associated with these pathologies. Methods: 658 adults who had been living in Galveston and Chambers counties, TX in the month before Hurricane Ike were interviewed 2-5 months after the hurricane. We collected information on experiences during and after Hurricane Ike, PTSD and depressive symptoms in the month before the interview, and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: The prevalence of past month hurricane-related PTSD and depression was 6.1 and 4.9%, respectively. Hurricane experiences, but not socio-demographic characteristics, were associated with Ike-related PTSD. By contrast, lower education and household income, and more lifetime stressors were associated with depression, as were hurricane exposures and hurricane-related stressors. When looking at specific hurricane-related stressors, loss or damage of sentimental possessions was associated with both PTSD and depression; however, health problems related to Ike were associated only with PTSD, whereas financial loss as a result of the hurricane was associated only with depression. Conclusions: PTSD is indeed a disorder of event exposure, whereas risk of depression is more clearly driven by personal vulnerability and exposure to stressors. The role of nontraumatic stressors in shaping risk of both pathologies suggests that alleviating stressors after disasters has clear potential to mitigate the psychological sequelae of these events.

   abstract = {In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.},

However, there are important privacy implications of the existence of such tracking apps. Here, we analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health. We hope in writing this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for the users. Importantly, though we discuss potential modifications, this document is not meant as a formal research paper, but instead is a response to some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like TraceTogether and an early-stage Request for Comments to the community.

To date, however, evacuees were often modeled as homogeneous without individual motivation in a large-scale urban simulation model, which is rather different from real human behavior. In this paper, an evacuation simulation model with human psychological models is developed for urban disaster situation. Three psychological models are actually incorporated: normalcy bias, emotional contagion bias, and sympathy behavior bias. Normalcy bias is the initial evacuation delay caused by a belief that abnormal events rarely happen. Emotional contagion is the effect of one person’s emotional state on the emotional state of people around him/her both explicitly and implicitly. Simulated experimental results show that the proposed model provides accurate evacuation behaviors than the normal behavior model without psychological consideration.},

Given the rareness of such events and the corresponding lack of real data, traffic simulation provides a flexible and versatile approach for such scenarios, and furthermore allows dynamic interaction with the simulated evacuation. In this paper, we build a traffic simulation pipeline to explore the above problems, covering many aspects of evacuation, including map creation, demand generation, vehicle behavior, bottleneck identification, traffic management policy improvement, and results analysis. We apply the pipeline to two cases studies in California. The first is Paradise, which was destroyed by a large wildfire in 2018 and experienced catastrophic traffic jams during the evacuation. The second is Mill Valley, which has high risk of wildfire and potential traffic issues since the city is situated in a narrow valley.},

   abstract = {Due to excess demand, we encounter traffic congestion on motorways quite often at bottlenecks in the vicinity of metropolitan areas in Japan, mainly on holidays. The administrators of motorways have tackled this issue for more than four decades. At the beginning, they just tried to increase the number of lanes; however, widening of motorways requires huge construction costs and long periods. After the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990s, it became so difficult to broaden the existing motorways. To alleviate traffic congestion, they have introduced comparatively costless innovative attempts; however, those could not eradicate traffic congestion completely. This paper describes the advantageous effects of innovative attempts, methodologies and applied cases, such as traffic information system providing location of the traffic bottleneck to drivers to activate them to gain speed on the upgrade, using the variable message signs, or traffic demand management disseminating real-time traffic information (e.g., travel time, length of the queue) to drivers, resulting in mitigation of traffic congestion on motorways. In recent years, toll discount has been introduced on motorways as a pilot program; the situation of traffic congestion is getting worse. This paper also mentions a quick overview of the countermeasure strategies against traffic congestion and of the state of the congestion on motorways for a couple of decades. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal-life and emergency situations. Our model adopts an agent-based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human-like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd-related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent can response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based on various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, a case study has been conducted, which shows that realistic human behaviors can be generated at both individual and group level.

To actuate platooning in a safe way it is necessary to design controllers able to effectively operate on informations exchanged via Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) systems despite the presence of unavoidable communication impairments, such as multiple time-varying delays that affect communication links. To this aim in this paper we propose a novel distributed adaptive collaborative control strategy that exploits information coming from connected vehicles to achieve leader synchronization and we analytically demonstrate its stability with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach.

To simplify the development of mobility simulators with support for heterogeneous hardware, we propose a novel data-driven approach in which the data layer is built such that multiple types of hardware can yield improved run time performance. Using this novel approach, we port an existing GPU-accelerated, large-scale, multi-modal, mobility simulator to modern many-core CPUs. While, a CPU backend runs 3.89 times slower compared to a GPU backend, the CPU backend is 11.64 times faster than another widely used agent-based simulator. Moreover, the run time of the CPU backend on ARM CPUs is comparable to the run time on x86 CPUs.},

   abstract = {The task of simulation of urban processes often concerns city traffic and road dynamics. Many assumptions in an urban science may be made by analysing traffic flows and vehicle behaviour on city streets. Since road traffic is a dynamic and possibly spatially large system that depends on many external conditions, approaches like visual analysis and computational steering may be used. There are many traffic modelling frameworks presented in the field, but there are also several drawbacks most of them have: they are limited to a specific model or case; have abstracted logic which disregards some factors affecting vehicle movement; they ignore possible physical interactions which are not described in a model or use too many simplifications in vehicle interaction simulations. In this paper, a novel agent-based traffic modelling framework is presented, combining different classes of traffic models into a single vehicle agent and allowing the user to set a specific model for each supported class. The framework was made using a game engine, Unreal Engine 4, which allows users to model realistic interaction between vehicles and make realistic visualisations for purposes of visual analysis and computational steering.},

   abstract = {We propose a multi-agent based computational framework for modeling decision-making and strategic interaction at micro level for smart vehicles in a smart world. The concepts of Markov game and best response dynamics are heavily leveraged. Our aim is to make the framework conceptually sound and computationally practical for a range of realistic applications, including micro path planning for autonomous vehicles. To this end, we first convert the would-be stochastic game problem into a closely related deterministic one by introducing risk premium in the utility function for each individual agent. We show how the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the simplified deterministic game can be solved by an algorithm based on best response dynamics. In order to better model human driving behaviors with bounded rationality, we seek to further simplify the solution concept by replacing the Nash equilibrium condition with a heuristic and adaptive optimization with finite look-ahead anticipation. In addition, the algorithm corresponding to the new solution concept drastically improves the computational efficiency. To demonstrate how our approach can be applied to realistic traffic settings, we conduct a simulation experiment: to derive merging and yielding behaviors on a double-lane highway with an unexpected barrier. Despite assumption differences involved in the two solution concepts, the derived numerical solutions show that the endogenized driving behaviors are very similar. We also briefly comment on how the proposed framework can be further extended in a number of directions in our forthcoming work, such as behavioral calibration using real traffic video data, and computational mechanism design for traffic policy optimization.},

   abstract = {This paper focusses on the role of driver individuality in the field of cognitive driver behavior modeling for the prospective safety impact assessment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving functions. Virtual traffic simulation requires valid models for the environment, the vehicle and the driver. Especially modeling human driver behavior is a major challenge, which in recent years has already led to the development of various driver models for the purpose of virtual simulation. Modeling human behavior in traffic with a precise representation of human cognition, capability and individuality, are crucial demands, which require thorough investigation and understanding of the human driver. Current driver behavior models often leave aside the aspect of driver individuality and lack the consideration of differences in driving behavior between different drivers. To take into account all the aspects from complex human cognitive processes to individual differences in action implementation, the Stochastic Cognitive Model (SCM) was developed. The SCM is based on five subcomponents: gaze control, information acquisition, mental model, action manager and situation manager (=decision making process) and action implementation. The aim of the present study is to provide a basis for establishing a solid logic for the integration of driver individuality into the current structure of the SCM by creating a new submodule that takes into account several behavior affecting driver characteristics. This subcomponent controls the stochastic variance in several driver behavior parameters, such as velocity or comfort longitudinal acceleration. In a representative driving simulator study with 43 participants, driver behavior on the highway was investigated and thoroughly analyzed. Information about several relevant driver characteristics and personality traits of the participants was collected and a logical hierarchical model was set up to cluster several dependent and independent variables into four layers: independent manifest driver variables, such as age or gender (Level 1), latent driver personality factors, such as thrill seeking or anxiety (Level 2), driver behavior dimensions, such as dynamics and law conformity (Level 3), and various dependent driver behavior parameters, such as velocity, acceleration or speed limit violation (Level 4). Multiple linear regression analyses were run to find the individual driver characteristics and personality traits, by which most of the stochastic variance in the measured driver behavior parameters can be explained. Subsequently, a principal component analysis (PCA) was run to test, if the previously clustered driver behavior parameters were loading on the presumed behavioral dimensions on the third level of the model to identify significant components of driver behavior, such as dynamics or law conformity. Results of the present study show significant correlations between driver characteristics and driver behavior parameters. According to the results of the PCA, variability in driver behavior can be explained to a great extent by three largely independent components: (1) Speed and cruise control, (2) Dynamics and (3) Driver performance. With the consideration of driver individuality in driver behavior models for the agent-based traffic simulation, validity of the results from prospective safety impact assessment analyses of automated driving functions can be enhanced. Beyond that, the findings of the current study can be used as a solid basis for the development of adaptive functions in the field of vehicle automation, considering the different driving skills and preferences of drivers with different individual profiles.},

It relays on the selfish behavior of the vehicle agent that benefits from a more accurate estimation of its travel time. The main novelty is that, rather than considering the average travel times in the network links according to the present vehicles, the vehicle must first know at what time it is able to cross the nodes located at both extremities of the road. This is achieved through a negotiation between the vehicle agent and the node agents to book the crossing time. In order to assess this new paradigm, this paper compares it with well-known approaches in an elementary network. The result invites to extend the approach to more general cases. A discussion of the opportunities and limitations of the approach extension is provided in this paper. One of the notable opportunities, is that the proposed approach has a great potential to improve the energy efficiency by exploring mobile navigation applications and connected autonomous vehicles.},

   abstract = {Modeling and simulation play an important role in transportation networks analysis. With the widespread use of personalized real-time information sources, the behavior of the simulation depends heavily on individual travelers reactions to the received information. As a consequence, it is relevant for the simulation model to be individual-centered, and multiagent simulation is the most promising paradigm in this context. However, representing the movements of realistic numbers of travelers within reasonable execution times requires significant computational resources. It also requires relevant methods, architectures and algorithms that respect the characteristics of transportation networks. In this paper, we define two multiagent simulation models representing the existing sequential multiagent traffic simulations. The first model is fundamental diagram-based model, in which travelers do not interact directly and use a fundamental diagram of traffic flow to continuously compute their speeds. The second model is car-following based, in which travelers interact with their neighbors to adapt their speeds to their surrounding environment. Then we define patterns to distribute these simulations in a high-performance environment. The first is agent-based and distributes agents equally between available computation units. The second pattern is environment-based and partitions the environment over the different units. The results show that agent-based distribution is more efficient with fundamental diagram-based model simulations while environment-based distribution is more efficient with car following-based simulations.},

The analytical framework is based on the energy ladder model and the energy stacking model as a starting point for assessing the current household energy profiles. A quantitative survey carried out in late 2015 in 970 households revealed differences in access to electricity between urban, electrified rural, and non-electrified rural districts. In urban areas, households are using multiple (3–4) energy sources compared to rural areas (2–3). The use of electricity through batteries in the non-electrified rural areas remains notable (43%) despite no access to the national grid. The dependence on traditional biomass, especially firewood, remains high (91% of all respondents) for all the sampled households, especially so in rural non-electrified households. The study confirms that households’ energy mix is composed of various energy sources, even when modern energy sources are available as opposed to complete fuel switch. The results also show that electricity use does not automatically lead to increased household income, but is much more complex process than discussed in existing research. The article further discusses the possible causes behind the phenomenon, proposes recommendations for better-informed energy policy, and provides important insights towards sustainable energy transition in Cambodia in the future.},

The wind speed is calculated by the Karlsruhe Atmospheric Mesoscale Model using atmospheric data from NCEP/NCAR for the years 1977-2006 as input data. Average wind speed is calculated by using the wind class approach. Wind data from four new wind measuring stations in Cambodia and from nearby wind measuring stations in Vietnam and Thailand are used to validate the model. The validation results show that the values of the calculated and measured wind speeds are in reasonable agreement. The values of wind speed obtained from the model are then used to generate the wind resource maps. The annual map reveals that relatively high wind speed areas are situated in the northeastern part of the country with the maximum annual mean wind speeds of 5-6 m/s.},

   abstract = {Autonomous driving has attracted significant research interests in the past two decades as it offers many potential benefits, including releasing drivers from exhausting driving and mitigating traffic congestion, among others. Despite promising progress, lane-changing remains a great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AV), especially in mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for lane-changing decision makings in AVs with encouraging results demonstrated. However, the majority of those studies are focused on a single-vehicle setting, and lane-changing in the context of multiple AVs coexisting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have received scarce attention. In this paper, we formulate the lane-changing decision-making of multiple AVs in a mixed-traffic highway environment as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where each AV makes lane-changing decisions based on the motions of both neighboring AVs and HDVs. Specifically, a multi-agent advantage actor-critic (MA2C) method is proposed with a novel local reward design and a parameter sharing scheme. In particular, a multi-objective reward function is designed to incorporate fuel efficiency, driving comfort, and the safety of autonomous driving. A comprehensive experimental study is made that our proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of efficiency, safety, and driver comfort.},

On the other hand, autonomous vehicles can overcome this inefficiency through perfect coordination. In this paper, we propose an intermediate solution, where we use vehicular communication and a small number of autonomous vehicles to improve the transportation system efficiency in such intersections. In our solution, two connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) lead multiple HDVs in a double-lane intersection in order to avoid congestion in front of the intersection. The CAVs are able to communicate and coordinate their behavior, which is controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. We design an altruistic reward function which enables CAVs to adjust their velocities flexibly in order to avoid queuing in front of the intersection. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is applied to train the policy and the generalized advantage estimation (GAE) is used to estimate state values. Training results show that two CAVs are able to achieve significantly better traffic efficiency compared to similar scenarios without and with one altruistic autonomous vehicle.},

   abstract = {A major challenge concerning a mixed traffic flow system, composed of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human driven vehicles (HDVs), is how to improve overall efficiency and safety by assigning appropriate control strategies to CAVs. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is a promising approach to address this challenge. It enables the joint training of multiple CAVs by fusing CAV sensing information and does not need the compliance of HDVs. However, the fusion of CAV sensing information is non-trivial. Traditional MADRL models usually fail to take advantage of connectivity among CAVs and time series characteristics of vehicle sensing information, leading to insufficient awareness of the traffic environment. Aimed at tackling these issues, this study proposes a MADRL framework integrating the double deep Q network (DDQN) and a spatiotemporal information extraction module, named spatiotemporal deep Q network (STDQN). A long-short term memory neural network with attention mechanism (AttenLSTMNN) is leveraged to extract temporal dependencies from vehicle perceptive information. Besides, a graph convolution network (GCN) is employed to model the spatial correlations among vehicles in a local range, as well as connectivity of multiple CAVs in a global range. Simulation experiments are conducted in an onramp merging scenario, which is one of the most important and commonly seen scenarios in highway or city expressway systems. Experimental results prove that as compared to baseline MADRL and rule-based methods, the proposed STDQN can improve the overall traffic efficiency, safety, and driving comfort. The proposed framework is promised to be deployed into real CAVs, to realize cooperative, safe, and efficient autonomous driving. keywords: Connected and autonomous vehicle; mixed traffic flow system; deep reinforcement learning; long-short term memory neural network; graph convolution network; cooperative merging.},

This includes safely and efficiently interacting with human-driven vehicles, especially in both conflictive and competitive scenarios. We build up on the prior work on socially-aware navigation and borrow the concept of social value orientation from psychology -- that formalizes how much importance a person allocates to the welfare of others -- in order to induce altruistic behavior in autonomous driving. In contrast with existing works that explicitly model the behavior of human drivers and rely on their expected response to create opportunities for cooperation, our Sympathetic Cooperative Driving (SymCoDrive) paradigm trains altruistic agents that realize safe and smooth traffic flow in competitive driving scenarios only from experiential learning and without any explicit coordination. We demonstrate a significant improvement in both safety and traffic-level metrics as a result of this altruistic behavior and importantly conclude that the level of altruism in agents requires proper tuning as agents that are too altruistic also lead to sub-optimal traffic flow.

Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle.

A group of autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HVs) which work together to optimize an altruistic social utility -- as opposed to the egoistic individual utility -- can co-exist seamlessly and assure safety and efficiency on the road. Achieving this mission without explicit coordination among agents is challenging, mainly due to the difficulty of predicting the behavior of humans with heterogeneous preferences in mixed-autonomy environments. Formally, we model an AV's maneuver planning in mixed-autonomy traffic as a partially-observable stochastic game and attempt to derive optimal policies that lead to socially-desirable outcomes using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. We introduce a quantitative representation of the AVs' social preferences and design a distributed reward structure that induces altruism into their decision making process. Our altruistic AVs are able to form alliances, guide the traffic, and affect the behavior of the HVs to handle competitive driving scenarios. As a case study, we compare egoistic AVs to our altruistic autonomous agents in a highway merging setting and demonstrate the emerging behaviors that lead to a noticeable improvement in the number of successful merges as well as the overall traffic flow and safety.},

The connected autonomous vehicles are able to exchange information as well as driving intentions with surrounding vehicles through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. We define three driving conditions for a given vehicle, namely, maximum, deadlock, and freerun, in which a deadlock condition implies that the vehicle is in a congestion condition that cannot be resolved alone. For the purpose of improving overall traffic flow, we design a strategy called Altruistic Cooperative Driving (ACD), in which a connected autonomous vehicle can automatically identify a deadlock condition and form a multi-vehicle coordination group to resolve the deadlock through a cooperative maneuver procedure. The proposed ACD is evaluated in our traffic simulator in terms of speed efficiency and communication traffic between the connected autonomous vehicles. The results show that ACD can improve speed efficiency and successfully resolve traffic congestion caused by deadlock conditions.},

Despite more than a decade of research and development, the problem of how to competently interact with diverse road users in diverse scenarios remains largely unsolved. Learning methods have much to offer towards solving this problem. But they require a realistic multi-agent simulator that generates diverse and competent driving interactions. To meet this need, we develop a dedicated simulation platform called SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School). SMARTS supports the training, accumulation, and use of diverse behavior models of road users. These are in turn used to create increasingly more realistic and diverse interactions that enable deeper and broader research on multi-agent interaction. In this paper, we describe the design goals of SMARTS, explain its basic architecture and its key features, and illustrate its use through concrete multi-agent experiments on interactive scenarios.

   abstract = {Planning and decision-making technology at intersections is a comprehensive research problem in intelligent transportation systems due to the uncertainties caused by a variety of traffic participants. As wireless communication advances, vehicle infrastructure integrated algorithms designed for intersection planning and decision-making have received increasing attention. In this paper, the recent studies on the planning and decision-making technologies at intersections are primarily overviewed. The general planning and decision-making approaches are presented, which include graph-based approach, prediction base approach, optimization-based approach and machine learning based approach. Since connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is the future direction for the automated driving area, we summarized the evolving planning and decision-making methods based on vehicle infrastructure cooperative technologies. Both four-way signalized and unsignalized intersection(s) are investigated under purely automated driving traffic and mixed traffic. The study benefit from current strategies, protocols, and simulation tools to help researchers identify the presented approaches' challenges and determine the research gaps, and several remaining possible research problems that need to be solved in the future.},

Numerous AIM designs have been proposed, but they lack a common vision of what defines a good system. In this study, the authors discuss a set of conflicting evaluation criteria that need to be balanced in the design of an AIM system, but are often considered individually in the literature. They then introduce their own priority-based design, where an intersection controller assigns priorities to incoming vehicles. On being assigned a priority, vehicles then cross the intersection while maintaining a so-called brake-safe state with respect to higher priority vehicles, rendering the system robust. They have performed extensive simulations to showcase the properties of the proposed system, and notably that it satisfactorily balances their criteria while remaining efficient.},

   abstract = {<p>Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Current methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology -- traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.</p>},

   abstract = {This paper presents a coordination scheme of automated vehicles at an intersection without using any traffic lights. Using a two-way communication network, vehicles approaching the intersection from all sections are globally coordinated, by considering their states all together in a model predictive control framework, in order to achieve smooth traffic flows at the intersection. The optimal trajectories of the vehicles are computed based on avoidance of their cross-collision risks around the intersection under relevant constraints and preferences. The scheme efficiently utilizes the intersection area by preventing each pair of conflicting vehicles from approaching their cross-collision point at the same time, instead of reserving the whole intersection area for the conflicting vehicles one after another. The scheme also enables left- or right-turning movements of vehicles under constrained velocity without using any auxiliary lanes. The proposed vehicle-intersection coordination scheme is evaluated through numerical simulation in a typical test intersection consisting of both multilanes and single-lane approaches with turning movements of vehicles. Observations under different traffic flow conditions reveal that the proposed scheme significantly improves intersection performance compared with the traditional signalized intersection scheme.},

This accident was one of the first collisions between full-sized autonomous road vehicles. Fortunately, both vehicles went on to finish the race and the collision was thoroughly documented in the vehicle logs. This collaborative study between MIT and Cornell traces the confluence of events that preceded the collision and examines its root causes. A summary of robot-robot interactions during the race is presented. The logs from both vehicles are used to show the gulf between robot and human-driver behavior at close vehicle proximities. Contributing factors are shown to be (1) difficulties in sensor data association leading to an inability to detect slow-moving vehicles and phantom obstacles, (2) failure to anticipate vehicle intent, and (3) an overemphasis on lane constraints versus vehicle proximity in motion planning. Finally, we discuss approaches that could address these issues in future systems, such as intervehicle communication, vehicle detection, and prioritized motion planning. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Autonomous intersection management requires time and speed adjustment of vehicles arriving at an intersection for collision-free passing through the intersection. Due to its computational complexity, this problem has been studied only when vehicle arrival times towards the vicinity of the intersection are known beforehand, which limits the applicability of these solutions for real-time deployment. To solve the real-time autonomous traffic intersection management problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based multiagent architecture and a novel RL algorithm coined multi-discount Q-learning. In multi-discount Q-learning, we introduce a simple yet effective way to solve a Markov Decision Process by preserving both short-term and long-term goals, which is crucial for collision-free speed control. Our empirical results show that our RL-based multiagent solution can achieve near-optimal performance efficiently when minimizing the travel time through an intersection.},

   abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

   abstract = {The development and application of autonomous vehicles bring great changes to urban traffic management and control. As one of the bottlenecks to improve transportation efficiency, intersection management plays an important role in the urban city. When the dynamic control method in different cases is determined, the key of autonomous intersection management problem is to search the passing orders for approaching connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The paper proposed a framework based on convolutional neural network to predict different passing orders’ total time consumption. Thus, the best passing order with the lowest time consume can be chosen as the optimal solution. Then continuous-time optimal control can be carried out on CAVs. Meanwhile, sequential model-based algorithm configuration technique is used for neural network training. Simulation results exported from Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) indicate that the proposed method outperforms actuated signal control and first come first serve strategy. The average delay of the proposed method can decrease by 42.40%–73.05% compared with actuated signal control and 2.95%–55.29% compared to first come first serve strategy. Moreover, it can increase average speed by more than 20% compared with the other two methods. The proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time comparing with the original planning-based strategy. At last, the framework can be applied to other regression tasks like vehicle emissions, then different optimization targets can be estimated to get better solutions faster.},

Based on a game-theoretic framework, a human-like payoff design methodology is proposed for the automated decision at unsignalized intersections. Prospect Theory is introduced to map the objective collision risk to the subjective driver payoffs, and the driving style can be quantified as a tradeoff between safety and speed. To account for the dynamics of interaction, a probabilistic model is further introduced to describe the acceleration tendency of drivers. Simulation results show that the proposed decision algorithm can describe the dynamic process of two-vehicle interaction in limit cases. Statistics of uniformly-sampled cases simulation indicate that the success rate of safe interaction reaches 98%, while the speed efficiency can also be guaranteed. The proposed approach is further applied and validated in four-vehicle interaction scenarios at a four-arm intersection.},

During the analysis of traffic accidents, we have put emphasis on the type of collision, manoeuvres and errors of the drivers of conventional vehicles that led to the traffic accident. Applying statistical analysis, we were found that the type of collision "rear-end" more often in traffic accidents with autonomous vehicles. Types of collisions "pedestrian" and "broadside" were less in traffic accidents with autonomous vehicles. Drivers' manoeuvres of conventional vehicles do not differ depending on whether an autonomous vehicle is involved in the traffic accident. Drivers' errors of conventional vehicles that are more often in accidents with autonomous vehicles are "unsafe speed" and "following too closely".

We propose a multi-agent system using a continuous, model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm used to train a neural network for predicting both the acceleration and the steering angle at each time step. We demonstrate that agents learn both the basic rules needed to handle intersections by understanding the priorities of other learners inside the environment, and to drive safely along their paths. Moreover, a comparison between our system and a rule-based method proves that our model achieves better results especially with dense traffic conditions. Finally, we test our system on real world scenarios using real recorded traffic data, proving that our module is able to generalize both to unseen environments and to different traffic conditions.},

   abstract = {Unsignalized intersection control is one of the most critical issues in intelligent transportation systems, which requires connected and automated vehicles to support more frequent information interaction and on-board computing. It is very promising to introduce reinforcement learning in the unsignalized intersection control. However, the existing multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms, such as multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), hardly handle a dynamic number of vehicles, which cannot meet the need of the real road condition. Thus, this paper proposes a Cooperative MADDPG (CoMADDPG) for connected vehicles at unsignalized intersection to solve this problem. Firstly, the scenario of multiple vehicles passing through an unsignalized intersection is formulated as a multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Secondly, MADDPG is redefined to adapt to the dynamic quantity agents, where each vehicle selects reference vehicles to construct a partial stationary environment, which is necessary for RL. Thirdly, this paper incorporates a novel vehicle selection method, which projects the reference vehicles on a virtual lane and selects the largest impact vehicles to construct the environment. At last, an intersection simulation platform is developed to evaluate the proposed method. According to the simulation result, CoMADDPG can reduce average travel time by 39.28% compared with the other optimization-based methods, which indicates that CoMADDPG has an excellent prospect in dealing with the scenario of unsignalized intersection control.},

This study aims to collate the research already completed in this domain and highlight an area of knowledge which is currently lacking sufficient investigation. The review shows that there is a wide range of topics and sub-topics covered in this area. We focused mainly on three key sub-topics that had fewest studies: adaptive tolling systems, autonomous parking facilities and predicting adoption over time. Past work on adaptive tolling has predominantly modelled situations where the traffic condition is uniform, whereas the impact of dynamic traffic and unexpected events or incidents has not yet been considered. Studies on autonomous parking facilities need to focus more on closely simulating normal operating conditions, such as having multiple operational vehicles, multiple parking spaces and a mix of CAVs and traditional vehicles. Although the positives of CAVs have been the predominant focus of discussion, the technology does present a number of uncertainties that make the full picture of its implementation and effects on its environments incomplete. An assumption made in many studies is that the market penetration of CAVs is 100%, however this will not be the case for some period of time. Therefore, studies need to consider the rate at which CAVs are adopted, which can be influenced by a number of factors.},

   abstract = {Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, formerly known as IntelliDrive, has emerged and is expected to provide unprecedented improvements in mobility. A recent study developed a cooperative vehicle intersection control (CVIC) algorithm for an urban intersection that does not require a stop-and-go style traffic signal and demonstrated significant mobility improvements over an actuated traffic signal control. This paper expanded the algorithm and implemented it to a corridor consisting of multiple intersections. In addition, this paper investigated sustainability aspects of the CVIC system for an urban traffic control system by applying surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) and VT-Micro model to measure safety and environmental impacts, respectively. A simulation-based case study was performed on a hypothetical arterial consisting of four intersections with eight traffic congestion cases covering low to high volume conditions. When compared to the coordinated actuated control, the CVIC system dramatically reduced the total delay times for the volume cases considered (i.e., from 82% to 100% delay time savings observed). The CVIC system also reduced the number of rear-end crash events by 30-87% for the volume cases considered, indicating that safer driving conditions would be achieved with the CVIC system. Finally, the CVIC system contributed to improving the air quality (i.e., 12-36% CO2 emission reduction) and saving fuel consumptions (11-37% of gas saving). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Autonomous driving technology is currently attracting a lot of attention as a technology that will play a role in the next generation of mobility. For autonomous driving in urban areas, it is necessary to recognize various information. Especially, the recognition of traffic lights is important in crossing intersections. In this paper, traffic light recognition technology developed by the authors was evaluated using onboard sensor data during autonomous driving in the Tokyo waterfront area as an example of traffic light recognition technology. Based on the results, it was found that traffic lights could be recognized with an accuracy of approximately 99% to carry out the decision making for intersection approaching. However, from the evaluation results, it was also confirmed that traffic light recognition became difficult under situations involving occlusion by other object, background assimilation, nighttime conditions, and backlight by sunlight. It was also confirmed that these effects are mostly temporary, and do not significantly affect decision-making to enter intersections as a result of utilizing information from multiple traffic lights installed at an intersection. On the other hand, it is expected that recognition with current onboard cameras will become technically difficult during situations in which not all traffic lights are visually recognizable due to the effects of back or front light by sunlight when stopped at the stop line of an intersection. This paper summarizes these results and presents the necessity of appropriate traffic light installation on the assumption of recognition by onboard cameras.},

We find clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our environment, each of which creates a new pressure for the opposing team to adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome obstacles using ramps. We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific intelligence tests.},

   abstract = {Convolutional neural networks often dominate fully-connected counterparts in generalization performance, especially on image classification tasks. This is often explained in terms of 'better inductive bias'. However, this has not been made mathematically rigorous, and the hurdle is that the fully connected net can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training algorithm plays a role. The current work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms. We construct a single natural distribution on $\mathbb\{R\}^d\times\\{\pm 1\\}$ on which any orthogonal-invariant algorithm (i.e. fully-connected networks trained with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires $\Omega(d^2)$ samples to generalize while $O(1)$ samples suffice for convolutional architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an $O(1)$ vs $\Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$ gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on fully-connected network is orthogonal equivariant. Similar results are achieved for $\ell_2$ regression and adaptive training algorithms, e.g. Adam and AdaGrad, which are only permutation equivariant.},

   abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a promising technique to improve the efficiency of signalized intersections, especially in the era of connected vehicles (CVs) when real-time information on vehicle positions and trajectories is available. Numerous ATSC algorithms have been proposed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions and optimize traffic efficiency. The common objective of these algorithms is to minimize total delay, decrease queue length, or maximize vehicle throughput. Despite their positive impacts on traffic mobility, the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety. This is most likely due to the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. However, recent research has developed various real-time safety models for signalized intersections. These models can be used to evaluate safety in real time using dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume, shock wave characteristics, and platoon ratio. Evaluating safety in real time can enable developing ATSC strategies for real-time safety optimization. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning ATSC algorithm to optimize the safety of signalized intersections. The algorithm was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach and was trained using the simulation platform VISSIM. The trained algorithm was then validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Compared to the traditional actuated signal control system, the proposed algorithm reduces traffic conflicts by approximately 40 %. Moreover, the proposed ATSC algorithm was tested under various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs. The results showed that 90 % and 50 % of the algorithm's safety benefits can be achieved at MPR values of 50 % and 30 %, respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first self-learning ATSC algorithm that optimizes traffic safety in real time.},

Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) is a new promising algorithm for ATSC, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) further promote its learning ability. However, there are some drawbacks in the state-of-the-art MDRL algorithms. (1) These algorithms cannot effectively fuse diverse heterogeneous information of traffic networks due to adopting homogeneous GNNs; (2) These algorithms cannot be effectively trained due to merely adopting MDRL loss functions. In this paper, we propose an Inductive Heterogeneous graph Attention-based Multi-agent Deep Graph Infomax (IHA-MDGI) algorithm for ATSC. The proposed IHA-MDGI algorithm conducts both feature fusion via a proposed Inductive Heterogeneous graph Attention (IHA) algorithm and training via a proposed Multi-agent Deep Graph Infomax (MDGI) framework. Specifically, (1) Unlike the algorithms which adopt homogeneous GNNs, in the IHA algorithm, heterogeneous GNNs are designed to fuse both heterogeneous structural information and heterogeneous features of traffic networks, which aims to acquire heterogeneous information embeddings of traffic networks. (2) In the MDGI framework, the acquired embeddings are used to calculate the signal-control policies and Q-value for each agent, and then a mutual-information loss function is designed, which combines with the MDRL loss function to jointly train the whole algorithm. The designed mutual-information loss function focuses on maximizing mutual information between input (i.e., heterogeneous information embeddings) and output (i.e., Q-value), which can produce cooperative signal-control policies and maximize Q-value. We conduct the experiments in both real-traffic and synthetic-traffic networks under the time-varying traffic flows, and the results demonstrate that IHA-MDGI algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art MDRL algorithms about multiple metrics.},

With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask can be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate property in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests with a simulated autonomous car in CARLA show that the performance of our method in urban scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned policy is able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving environment.

Therefore, autonomous vehicles need to behave as similar to human drivers as possible, to ensure that their behavior can be effectively understood by the drivers of other vehicles and be more in line with the cognition of humans on driving behavior. Therefore, this paper studies the evaluation function of human drivers, using the method of inverse reinforcement learning, aiming for the learned behavior to better imitate the behavior of human drivers. At the same time, this paper proposes a semi-Markov model, to extract the intentions of surrounding related vehicles and divides them into defensive and cooperative, leading the vehicle to adopt a reasonable response to different types of driving scenarios.</p>},

   abstract = {Unlike popular modularized framework, end-to-end autonomous driving seeks to solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which can be more adapting to new scenarios and easier to generalize at scale. However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and can only deal with simple driving tasks like lane keeping. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask can be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate property in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests with a simulated autonomous car in CARLA show that the performance of our method in urban scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned policy is able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving environment. The codes and videos of this work are available at our github repo and project website.},

This is mainly due to the lack of domain adaptation between simulated and real-world data together with the absence of distinction between train and test datasets. In this work, we investigate these problems in the autonomous driving field, especially for a maneuver planning module for roundabout insertions. In particular, we present a system based on multiple environments in which agents are trained simultaneously, evaluating the behavior of the model in different scenarios. Finally, we analyze techniques aimed at reducing the gap between simulated and real-world data showing that this increased the generalization capabilities of the system both on unseen and real-world scenarios.},

   abstract = {Automated vehicles rely heavily on data-driven methods, especially for complex urban environments. Large datasets of real world measurement data in the form of road user trajectories are crucial for several tasks like road user prediction models or scenario-based safety validation. So far, though, this demand is unmet as no public dataset of urban road user trajectories is available in an appropriate size, quality and variety. By contrast, the highway drone dataset (highD) has recently shown that drones are an efficient method for acquiring naturalistic road user trajectories. Compared to driving studies or ground-level infrastructure sensors, one major advantage of using a drone is the possibility to record naturalistic behavior, as road users do not notice measurements taking place. Due to the ideal viewing angle, an entire intersection scenario can be measured with significantly less occlusion than with sensors at ground level. Both the class and the trajectory of each road user can be extracted from the video recordings with high precision using state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose the creation of a comprehensive, large-scale urban intersection dataset with naturalistic road user behavior using camera-equipped drones as successor of the highD dataset. The resulting dataset contains more than 11500 road users including vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians at intersections in Germany and is called inD. The dataset consists of 10 hours of measurement data from four intersections and is available online for non-commercial research at: http://www.inD-dataset.com},

   abstract = {Self-Driven Particles (SDP) describe a category of multi-agent systems common in everyday life, such as flocking birds and traffic flows. In a SDP system, each agent pursues its own goal and constantly changes its cooperative or competitive behaviors with its nearby agents. Manually designing the controllers for such SDP system is time-consuming, while the resulting emergent behaviors are often not realistic nor generalizable. Thus the realistic simulation of SDP systems remains challenging. Reinforcement learning provides an appealing alternative for automating the development of the controller for SDP. However, previous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods define the agents to be teammates or enemies before hand, which fail to capture the essence of SDP where the role of each agent varies to be cooperative or competitive even within one episode. To simulate SDP with MARL, a key challenge is to coordinate agents' behaviors while still maximizing individual objectives. Taking traffic simulation as the testing bed, in this work we develop a novel MARL method called Coordinated Policy Optimization (CoPO), which incorporates social psychology principle to learn neural controller for SDP. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared to MARL baselines in various metrics. Noticeably the trained vehicles exhibit complex and diverse social behaviors that improve performance and safety of the population as a whole.

The shield is introduced in the traditional learning process in two alternative ways, depending on the location at which the shield is implemented. In the first one, the shield acts each time the learning agent is about to make a decision and provides a list of safe actions. In the second way, the shield is introduced after the learning agent. The shield monitors the actions from the learner and corrects them only if the chosen action causes a violation of the specification. We discuss which requirements a shield must meet to preserve the convergence guarantees of the learner.

In factored shielding, we synthesize multiple shields based on a factorization of the joint state space observed by all agents; the set of shields monitors agents concurrently and each shield is only responsible for a subset of agents at each step.Experimental results show that both approaches can guarantee the safety of agents during learning without compromising the quality of learned policies; moreover, factored shielding is more scalable in the number of agents than centralized shielding.},

Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL.

The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques.

   abstract = {Making sophisticated, robust, and safe sequential decisions is at the heart of intelligent systems. This is especially critical for planning in complex multi-agent environments, where agents need to anticipate other agents' intentions and possible future actions. Traditional methods formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, but the solutions often rely on various assumptions and become brittle when presented with corner cases. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been very effective at finding policies by simultaneously exploring, interacting, and learning from environments. Leveraging the powerful Deep RL paradigm, we demonstrate that an iterative procedure of self-play can create progressively more diverse environments, leading to the learning of sophisticated and robust multi-agent policies. We demonstrate this in a challenging multi-agent simulation of merging traffic, where agents must interact and negotiate with others in order to successfully merge on or off the road. While the environment starts off simple, we increase its complexity by iteratively adding an increasingly diverse set of agents to the agent "zoo" as training progresses. Qualitatively, we find that through self-play, our policies automatically learn interesting behaviors such as defensive driving, overtaking, yielding, and the use of signal lights to communicate intentions to other agents. In addition, quantitatively, we show a dramatic improvement of the success rate of merging maneuvers from 63% to over 98%.},

However, the players cannot impose a specific outcome on others and if no agreement is reached all players receive a predetermined status quo outcome. Bargaining games have been studied from a variety of fields, including game theory, economics, psychology and simulation based methods like genetic algorithms. In this work we extend the analysis by means of deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To study the dynamics of bargaining with reinforcement learning we propose two different bargaining environments which display the following situations: in the first domain two agents have to agree on the division of an asset, e.g., the division of a fixed amount of money between each other. The second domain models a seller-buyer scenario in which agents must agree on a price for a product. We empirically demonstrate that the bargaining result under MARL is influenced by agents’ risk-aversion as well as information asymmetry between agents.},

   abstract = {Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multi-agent systems, especially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as exponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes it difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a novel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI) is presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL algorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for agents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile (non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented NegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for sparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum variance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of local Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared value functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to achieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational complexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI algorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria: steps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime (AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games and shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm. Then in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent warehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.},

   abstract = {When autonomous agents interact in the same environment, they must often cooperate to achieve their goals. One way for agents to cooperate effectively is to form a team, make a binding agreement on a joint plan, and execute it. However, when agents are self-interested, the gains from team formation must be allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for multi-agent negotiation have been proposed, but typically only work for particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human input or domain-specific data, and so do not scale. To address this, we propose a framework for training agents to negotiate and form teams using deep reinforcement learning. Importantly, our method makes no assumptions about the specific negotiation protocol, and is instead completely experience driven. We evaluate our approach on both non-spatial and spatially extended team-formation negotiation environments, demonstrating that our agents beat hand-crafted bots and reach negotiation outcomes consistent with fair solutions predicted by cooperative game theory. Additionally, we investigate how the physical location of agents influences negotiation outcomes.},

   abstract = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has important implications for the future of human-agent teaming. We show that improved performance with multi-agent RL is not a guarantee of the collaborative behavior thought to be important for solving multi-agent tasks. To address this, we present a novel approach for quantitatively assessing collaboration in continuous spatial tasks with multi-agent RL. Such a metric is useful for measuring collaboration between computational agents and may serve as a training signal for collaboration in future RL paradigms involving humans. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) is an attractive option for providing adaptive behavior in computational agents because of its theoretical generalizability to complex problem spaces [1, 2]. In particular, deep RL recently produced striking results [3]. Extending RL to the multi-agent domain has received an increasing amount of attention as the need for human-agent teams has increased, especially with regards to training agents to behave collaboratively [1, 4-8]. Unfortunately, the nature of multi-agent RL makes guaranteeing collaboration between agents impossible except in limited provable cases, even when these methods yield better task performance [1, 7]. Thus far, evaluating collaboration in multi-agent learning has been accomplished by measuring performance in tasks where coordination is required. While this may be satisfactory for discretized tasks where cooperative policies are provably optimal [1, 6-8] it is not clear that this methodology generalizes well to more complex and continuous tasks (such as those presented in [4, 5] and here). The question at hand is how to assess performance enhancing coordination (or collaboration) between agents in multi-agent RL tasks. Here, we present a method borrowed from the field of ecology, called convergence cross mapping (CCM), and show how it can be used to measure collaboration between agents during a predator-prey pursuit task. Additionally, we show a striking result: a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm does not exhibit coordinated behavior between agents},

This paper investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a multi-agent environment can learn to use social learning to improve their performance. We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency , and show that by imposing constraints on the training environment and introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able to obtain generalized social learning policies which enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online to novel environments by taking cues from experts present in the new environment. In contrast, agents trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo training, we can obtain agents that use social learning to gain skills that they can deploy when alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from the start.},

   abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence often stem from the development of new environments that abstract real-world situations into a form where research can be done conveniently. This paper contributes such an environment based on ideas inspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce resources in a spatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that they prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing behaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by supply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where the agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local abundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then discover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of ablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards, bartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work is part of the environment development branch of a research program that aims to build human-like artificial general intelligence through multi-agent interactions in simulated societies. By exploring which environment features are needed for the basic phenomena of elementary microeconomics to emerge automatically from learning, we arrive at an environment that differs from those studied in prior multi-agent reinforcement learning work along several dimensions. For example, the model incorporates heterogeneous tastes and physical abilities, and agents negotiate with one another as a grounded form of communication.},

   abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We applied it successfully in a recent Kaggle competition and were able to reach the third position with relative simple features. We further demonstrate in this paper that entity embedding helps the neural network to generalize better when the data is sparse and statistics is unknown. Thus it is especially useful for datasets with lots of high cardinality features, where other methods tend to overfit. We also demonstrate that the embeddings obtained from the trained neural network boost the performance of all tested machine learning methods considerably when used as the input features instead. As entity embedding defines a distance measure for categorical variables it can be used for visualizing categorical data and for data clustering.},

These systems generate electricity to fulfill the energy demands together with the existing resources as well as power including medical facilities situated in remote areas of Uganda where the main national electricity infrastructure has not been reached. In this paper, an off-grid PV system for rural medical facilities and the emergency situation has been simulated and modelled using the MATLAB Simulink toolbox. Because of the difference in temperature, solar irradiance, PV temperature, shading conditions, ambient temperature, wind speed, and dust, the electrical power generated by a photovoltaic (PV) module and hence the power sent to the load fluctuates, which rises the need to carry out analysis of the entire PV system to obtain peak and maximum power under these variable situations. In this paper, a complete off-grid PV module renewable energy generating system has been designed and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and performance has been analyzed by subjecting the PV panels to various irradiances starting from 1 KW/m-2 for the Ugandan case. The simulation model consists of a solar PV array, and the battery system, the converter power stage with PWM control, and charge controlling functions and the performance of each block has been studied continuously. Finally, it has been found that this model is quite capable to simulate both the P-V and I-V characteristics of a PV module, and based on the result it has been forecast that the performance of several modules or even PV arrays connected in series and/or in parallel with the delivery of maximum power can be tested under diverse temperature and solar irradiances.},

First, PV power curves are plotted for different design parameters to illustrate the amplification of errors and to enhance the understanding of the presented phenomena. Second, six forecast accuracy metrics are calculated as a function of the design parameters for the irradiance observation and forecast data of ten stations from five climate zones and two forecast providers. Third, the Pareto-optimal tradeoff between the annual energy production and the absolute forecast errors are obtained by the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm. The results reveal that the design parameters highly influence the PV power forecast errors, which is important to consider in all studies presenting PV power forecast verification. A tilt angle of 45° increases the error metrics up to 49% compared to a horizontal plane, and undersizing the inverters by a 1.5 sizing factor lead to an average error decrease up to 25%. Including the expected forecast errors as an objective during their design optimization process is important to maximize the net revenues of PV plants, especially if the unit imbalance costs are more than 50% of the electricity prices.},

These metamodels are used to determine the final optimal ABP. The optimization procedure is then repeated for different TSRs to determine an optimal ABP as a function of the TSR. The power outputs for the ABP-driven VAWT are compared with those of a fixed blade VAWT at different TSRs. The results indicate a 13% increase in the maximum power output of the VAWT compared to an optimal fixed pitch strategy. The torque outputs of the ABP-driven VAWT are then compared with those of a fixed blade VAWT at low TSRs.

A generic formulation that uses five governing parameters to represent the solution space of the optimal blade pitch control is developed through an in-depth analysis of the relationship between blade pitch and the output power of VAWTs. Subsequently, a variable blade pitch automatic optimization platform (VBPAOP) composed of genetic algorithm and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation modules is built to search for optimal blade pitches that can maximize turbine power. A 2D unsteady CFD model is used as a performance evaluation tool because of its high computational efficiency, and its accuracy is validated through wind tunnel experiments prior to its application in optimization. Results show that in a wide range of tip speed ratios (TSRs), the optimized blade pitches can increase the average power coefficients by 0.177 and 0.317, respectively, in two simulated VAWT models with different chord lengths. At stages below the rated TSR, stall-induced torque losses are delayed or even avoided by the proposed optimized pitch control. At stages beyond the rated TSR, energy extraction in the downwind zone is improved due to increased upwind wake velocity.},

   abstract = {Hybrid energy systems (HES) that contain renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy help to minimize CO2 emissions. Therefore, studying these systems to improve their performance has become one of the critical needs these days due to the environmental crisis. Within HES, energy management (EM) of HES is an essential topic that has been covered in detail by numerous studies, as errors in EM can lead to HES blackouts. Recent research has experimented with energy management strategy (EMS) to achieve optimal EM. This work aims to generate a robust forecasting model for one hour ahead of EM. The present research work has two main objectives. The first objective is to determine which energy source should supply the demand side, using different machine-learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The second objective is to compare the results of these algorithms to choose the algorithm with the best performance and to rank them based on performance as well as accuracy. The work is validated using different algorithms. The results show that DT algorithm has achieved the best performance compared to the RF and Gaussian NB algorithms. KNN algorithm gives the lowest accuracy especially over class 3. The results proof that RF, DT, and Gaussian NB algorithms are reliable.},

Usually, machine learning algorithms focus on fine-tuning the hyperparameters, but our proposed hybrid algorithm focuses on the preprocessing using feature engineering to improve forecasting.

Traditional power grid can be transformed into a smart grid by augmenting it with information and communication technologies, and machine intelligence. Machine learning and artificial intelligence can enable smart grid to make intelligent decisions and respond to sudden changes in customer demands, power outages, sudden drops and rises in renewable energy output or any other catastrophic events. Machine learning can also help capture customer consumption patterns, forecast energy demand and power generation of intermittent sources, and predict equipment failures. Reinforced learning can aid in making energy dispatch decisions and activate demand management signals in order to maintain balance of power supply and demand. The usage of wireless technologies in smart grid renders it vulnerable to cyber security threats. With the increase in data volume, it is now possible to employ machine learning for the detection and prevention of anomalous behaviour, intrusion, cyber-attacks, and malicious activities as well as data authentication. This paper reviews the application of different machine learning approaches that aims at enhancing the stability, reliability, security, efficiency and responsiveness of smart grid.

Applications are forecasts for renewable energy generation and energy consumption. Forecasts are elementary for sector coupling, where energy-consuming sectors are interconnected with the power-generating sector to address electricity storage challenges by adding flexibility to the power system. However, the large-scale application of machine learning methods in energy systems is impaired by the need for expert knowledge, which covers machine learning expertise and a profound understanding of the application's process. The process knowledge is required for the problem formalization, as well as the model validation and application. The machine learning skills include the processing steps of i) data pre-processing, ii) feature engineering, extraction, and selection, iii) algorithm selection, iv) hyperparameter optimization, and possibly v) post-processing of the model's output. Tailoring a model for a particular application requires selecting the data, designing various candidate models and organizing the data flow between the processing steps, selecting the most suitable model, and monitoring the model during operation - an iterative and time-consuming procedure. Automated design and operation of machine learning aim to reduce the human effort to address the increasing demand for data-driven models. We define five levels of automation for forecasting in alignment with the SAE standard for autonomous vehicles, where manual design and application reflect Automation level 0.},

Traditional methods for such problems rely on general-purpose sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which typically requires manual intervention for tuning parameters and does not work efficiently in practice. Instead, SAGD makes use of the Langevin algorithm to construct stochastic gradients that are biased in finite steps but accurate asymptotically, enabling us to theoretically establish the convergence guarantee for SAGD. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we also provide useful guidelines for its practical implementation.

This challenges widely held believes and immediately raises the question why KFAC performs so well. Towards answering this question we present evidence strongly suggesting that KFAC approximates a first-order algorithm, which performs gradient descent on neurons rather than weights.

With the huge amount of data collected every day, machine learning is seen as a key enabling approach for predictive maintenance of wind turbines. However, most of the effort is put into the optimization of the model architectures and its parameters, whereas data-related aspects are often neglected. The goal of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of wind turbines through a data-centric machine learning methodology.

Precise forecasting of wind power generation is crucial to mitigate the challenges of balancing supply and demand in the smart grid. Nevertheless, the major difficulty in wind power is its high fluctuation and intermittent nature, making it challenging to forecast. This study aims to develop efficient data-driven models to accurately forecast wind power generation. Crucially, the main contributions of this work are listed in the following major elements. Firstly, we investigate the performance of enhanced machine learning models to forecast univariate wind power time-series data. Specifically, we employed Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimally tune hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) with different kernels, and ensemble learning (ES) models (i.e., Boosted trees and Bagged trees) and investigated their forecasting performance. Secondly, dynamic information has been incorporated in their construction to further enhance the forecasting performance of the investigated models. Specifically, we introduce lagged measurements to enable capturing time evolution into the design of the considered models. Furthermore, more input variables (e.g., wind speed and wind direction) are used to further improve wind prediction performance. Actual measurements from three wind turbines in France, Turkey, and Kaggle are used to verify the efficiency of the considered models. The results reveal the benefit of considering lagged data and input variables to better forecast wind power. The results also showed that the optimized GPR and ensemble models outperformed the other machine learning models.},

   abstract = {Real-time optimization (RTO) covers a family of optimization methods that incorporate process measurements in the optimization to drive the real process (plant) to optimal performance while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. Modifier Adaptation (MA) introduces zeroth and first-order correction terms (bias and gradients) for the cost and constraint functions. Instead of updating the plant model, in MA the optimization problem is updated directly from data guaranteeing to meet the necessary condition of optimality upon convergence. 5 The main burden of the MA approach is the estimation of the first-order modifiers of the cost and constraint functions at each RTO iteration. Finite-difference approximation is the most common approach that requires at least nu + 1 steady-state operation points to estimate the gradients, where nu is the number of control inputs. Obtaining these can require a long convergence time. For this reason, this work considers the use of Gaussian process (GP) regression to estimate the plant-model mismatch based on plant measurements, and replace the usual modifiers by these high order regression functions. GP is a probabilistic, non-10 parametric modelling technique well known in the machine learning community. The approach is tested on several numerical test cases simulating wind farms. It is shown that the approach is able to correct the model and converges to the plant optimal point. Several improvements for large inputs spaces, which is a challenging problem for the approach presented in the article, are discussed.},

Therefore, combinations of elements that highlight relationships between clients need to be investigated in order to achieve more accurate consumption predictions. In this study, we exploited the combined effects of client similarity and causality, and developed a power consumption forecasting model that utilizes ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our novel approach enables the derivation of different representations of the predicted consumption based on feature sets influenced by similarity and causality metrics. The resulting representations were used to train a meta-model, based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in order to combine the results of the LSTM ensembles optimally. This combinatorial approach achieved better overall performance and yielded lower mean absolute percentage error when compared to the standalone LSTM ensembles that do not include similarity and causality. Additional experiments indicated that the combination of similarity and causality resulted in more performant models when compared to implementations utilizing only one element on the same model structure.},

This dissonance causes an estimation bias that can be eliminated if the Beta distribution is used for the policy instead, as it presents a finite support. In this work, we investigate how this Beta policy performs when it is trained by the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm on two continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym. For both tasks, the Beta policy is superior to the Gaussian policy in terms of agent's final expected reward, also showing more stability and faster convergence of the training process. For the CarRacing environment with high-dimensional image input, the agent's success rate was improved by 63% over the Gaussian policy.},

   abstract = {Independent reinforcement learning algorithms have no theoretical guarantees for finding the best policy in multi-agent settings. However, in practice, prior works have reported good performance with independent algorithms in some domains and bad performance in others. Moreover, a comprehensive study of the strengths and weaknesses of independent algorithms is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we carry out an empirical comparison of the performance of independent algorithms on four PettingZoo environments that span the three main categories of multi-agent environments, i.e., cooperative, competitive, and mixed. We show that in fully-observable environments, independent algorithms can perform on par with multi-agent algorithms in cooperative and competitive settings. For the mixed environments, we show that agents trained via independent algorithms learn to perform well individually, but fail to learn to cooperate with allies and compete with enemies. We also show that adding recurrence improves the learning of independent algorithms in cooperative partially observable environments.},

   abstract = {Recently, reinforcement learning with deep neu-ral networks has achieved great success in challenging continuous control problems such as 3D locomotion and robotic manipulation. However, in real-world control problems, the actions one can take are bounded by physical constraints, which introduces a bias when the standard Gaus-sian distribution is used as the stochastic policy. In this work, we propose to use the Beta distribution as an alternative and analyze the bias and variance of the policy gradients of both policies. We show that the Beta policy is bias-free and provides significantly faster convergence and higher scores over the Gaussian policy when both are used with trust region policy optimization (TRPO) and actor critic with experience replay (ACER), the state-of-the-art on-and off-policy stochastic methods respectively, on Ope-nAI Gym's and MuJoCo's continuous control environments .},

   abstract = {Driving safely requires multiple capabilities from human and intelligent agents, such as the generalizability to unseen environments, the safety awareness of the surrounding traffic, and the decision-making in complex multi-agent settings. Despite the great success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), most of the RL research works investigate each capability separately due to the lack of integrated environments. In this work, we develop a new driving simulation platform called MetaDrive to support the research of generalizable reinforcement learning algorithms for machine autonomy. MetaDrive is highly compositional, which can generate an infinite number of diverse driving scenarios from both the procedural generation and the real data importing. Based on MetaDrive, we construct a variety of RL tasks and baselines in both single-agent and multi-agent settings, including benchmarking generalizability across unseen scenes, safe exploration, and learning multi-agent traffic. The generalization experiments conducted on both procedurally generated scenarios and real-world scenarios show that increasing the diversity and the size of the training set leads to the improvement of the RL agent's generalizability. We further evaluate various safe reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in MetaDrive environments and provide the benchmarks. Source code, documentation, and demo video are available at https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive.},

   abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},
